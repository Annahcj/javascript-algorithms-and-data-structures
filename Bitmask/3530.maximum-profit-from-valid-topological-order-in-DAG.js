// 3530. Maximum Profit from Valid Topological Order in DAG
// You are given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, represented by a 2D array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates a directed edge from node ui to vi. Each node has an associated score given in an array score, where score[i] represents the score of node i.
// You must process the nodes in a valid topological order. Each node is assigned a 1-based position in the processing order.
// The profit is calculated by summing up the product of each node's score and its position in the ordering.
// Return the maximum possible profit achievable with an optimal topological order.
// A topological order of a DAG is a linear ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge u â†’ v, node u comes before v in the ordering.


// Solution: DP w/ Bitmasks

// DP with bitmasks to keep track of nodes we have already visited.
// For every dp(mask), 
  // iterate through each node we haven't visited, as the next node
  // and check that all prerequisites have already been visited.

// Finding prerequisites for each node:
  // We only need to know the direct parents of each node, 
  // because if those direct parents have been visited, that means the parent's parents would have been visited too.

// Time Complexity: O(n * 2^n) 3323ms
// Space Complexity: O(2^n) 276MB
