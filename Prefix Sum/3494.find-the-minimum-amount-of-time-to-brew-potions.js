// 3494. Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions
// You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.
// In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].
// Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹
// Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.


// Solution: Prefix Sum

// For each potion,
  // Calculate the minimum start time for the current potion by getting the maximum time out of all the wizards for the previous potion.
  // To calculate the maximum start time, for each wizard get the difference between the previous end time and the base start time (as if current potion starts at time 0).
// Keep track of the finish times of all the wizards for the previous potion.

// Time Complexity: O(nm) 405ms
// Space Complexity: O(n) 61MB

    let maxFinishTime = 0, baseTime = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      const diff = prevFinishTime[i] - baseTime;
